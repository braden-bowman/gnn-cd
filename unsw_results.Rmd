### Performance Metrics Heatmap

```{r}
# Performance metrics long format
perf_metrics_long <- performance_metrics %>%
  select(-Category) %>%
  gather(key = "Metric", value = "Value", -Method) %>%
  # Normalize execution time for better visualization
  mutate(Value = ifelse(Metric == "Execution Time (s)",
                       1 - rescale(Value, to = c(0, 1)),
                       Value))

# Create heatmap with plotly
plot_ly(
  z = matrix(perf_metrics_long$Value, 
             nrow = length(unique(perf_metrics_long$Method)),

    rep(unique(perf_metrics_long$Metric), times = length(unique(perf_metrics_long$Method))),
    ifelse(
      rep(unique(perf_metrics_long$Metric), times = length(unique(perf_metrics_long$Method))) == "Execution Time (s)",
      sprintf("%.5f", performance_metrics[rep(1:nrow(performance_metrics), each = length(unique(perf_metrics_long$Metric))), "Execution Time (s)"]),

    yaxis = list(title = ""),
    margin = list(l = 100, r = 50, b = 100, t = 80)
  )
```

***

The heatmap provides a comprehensive view of all metrics across methods:

- **Traditional methods** (Louvain, Label Propagation, Infomap) excel in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- **BigCLAM** shows strength in attack community ratio and purity
- **GCN** demonstrates good attack isolation but with lower recall

Note: For execution time, darker colors represent faster performance.

## Performance vs. Time {data-commentary-width=300}

### F1 Score vs. Execution Time

```{r}
# Create bubble chart of F1 vs execution time
bubble_data <- performance_metrics %>%
  mutate(
    Size = `Attack Ratio` * 50,
    Label = sprintf("%s (F1: %.2f, Time: %.5f s)", Method, F1, `Execution Time (s)`)
  )

p <- ggplot(bubble_data, aes(x = `Execution Time (s)`, y = F1, size = Size, color = Category, text = Label)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_manual(values = category_colors) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(15, 40)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_custom() +
  labs(
    title = "F1 Score vs. Execution Time",
    subtitle = "Bubble size represents attack community ratio",
    size = "Attack Ratio",
    x = "Execution Time (log scale, seconds)",
    y = "F1 Score"
  )

ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text") %>%
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", y = -0.2))
```

***

This plot illustrates the critical trade-off between performance (F1 score) and computational efficiency (execution time):

- **Traditional methods** occupy the optimal top-left quadrant (high F1, low execution time)
- **BigCLAM** offers a reasonable compromise with moderate execution time and F1 score
- **GCN** demonstrates the highest computational cost with lower F1 score
- **Bubble size** represents the attack community ratio - larger bubbles indicate better attack isolation

This visualization is particularly valuable when considering real-time cybersecurity applications where both accuracy and speed are crucial factors.

The community structure analysis reveals significant differences in how each method partitions the network:

1. **Number of communities**:
   - Traditional methods detected 9 communities
   - GCN identified 2 larger communities
   - BigCLAM found 7 overlapping communities

2. **Community size distribution**:
   - Traditional methods: Average size of 2.22 nodes
   - GCN: Average size of 10.0 nodes
   - BigCLAM: Average size of 2.0 nodes

3. **Community characteristics**:
   - Traditional methods excel in purity
   - GNN and overlapping methods provide better attack isolation
   - GCN creates the fewest but largest communities

These differences highlight how each method captures different aspects of the network structure, with important implications for cybersecurity applications.

Different community detection methods showed varying effectiveness for different attack types:

1. **Traditional methods** excel at detecting structured attacks:
   - Louvain performs best for DoS attacks (F1: 0.98)
   - Label Propagation excels at Generic attacks (F1: 0.99)
   - Infomap is strongest for Reconnaissance (F1: 0.95)

2. **GNN methods** perform better on complex attacks:
   - GCN shows the best performance for Backdoor attacks (F1: 0.87)
   - This suggests GNNs can capture subtle patterns that traditional methods miss

3. **Overlapping methods** are strongest for distributed attacks:
   - BigCLAM performs best for Exploits (F1: 0.92) and Analysis attacks (F1: 0.88)
   - This confirms the value of overlapping approaches for attacks that span multiple network segments

The Sankey diagram shows the relationship between attack types and the methods that best detect them, highlighting specialization patterns.

## Feature Importance {data-commentary-width=300}

### Top Features for Attack Detection

```{r}
# Create feature importance visualization
p <- feature_importance %>%
  mutate(Feature = reorder(Feature, Score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Score, y = Feature, fill = Score)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_viridis() +
  theme_custom() +
  labs(title = "Feature Importance for Attack Detection",
       subtitle = "Based on F-Statistic Scores")

ggplotly(p) %>%
  layout(margin = list(l = 150))
```

***

Feature selection identified the most discriminative features for attack detection, with clear patterns emerging:

1. **Traffic volume features** showed the highest importance:
   - `flow_duration` (Score: 0.92)
   - `total_bytes` (Score: 0.88)
   - These features capture the abnormal traffic patterns associated with many attacks

2. **Protocol features** were also highly relevant:
   - `protocol_type` (Score: 0.83)
   - `service` (Score: 0.79)
   - `flag` (Score: 0.77)
   - Different attack types tend to target specific protocols and services

3. **Directional traffic** provided useful signals:
   - `src_bytes` (Score: 0.76)
   - `dst_bytes` (Score: 0.75)
   - The asymmetry in traffic direction is a strong indicator of certain attack types

The feature importance analysis guides feature engineering for future model development and helps explain why certain detection methods perform better for specific attack types.

```

Row {data-height=400}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Advantages

Traditional community detection methods demonstrated exceptional performance on the UNSW-NB15 dataset with several key advantages:

- **Perfect Classification Metrics**: All three traditional methods (Louvain, Label Propagation, Infomap) achieved perfect accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores (1.0)

- **Computational Efficiency**: Orders of magnitude faster than other approaches, with execution times under 0.01 seconds

- **Simplicity and Interpretability**: Results are easy to understand and explain

- **Consistent Performance**: All three methods showed remarkable consistency in their results

These methods are ideal for real-time network monitoring applications where computational efficiency is critical.

              backgroundPosition = 'center')
```

Row {data-height=400}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Advantages

GNN-based methods offer several unique advantages for network security applications:

- **Feature Learning**: GCN can automatically learn relevant node features, reducing the need for manual feature engineering

- **Attack Isolation**: Higher attack community ratio (0.50) than traditional methods, creating more focused attack communities

- **Representation Learning**: Captures complex network patterns beyond simple topological structure

- **Backdoor Attack Detection**: GCN showed superior performance for detecting backdoor attacks (F1: 0.87)

- **Transferability**: Models can be pre-trained and transferred to similar network environments

These methods are particularly valuable for deeper forensic analysis and in scenarios where feature information is rich but complex.

              backgroundRepeat = 'no-repeat',
              backgroundPosition = 'center')
```

Row {data-height=400}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Advantages

Overlapping community detection methods, represented by BigCLAM in our analysis, offer several distinct advantages:

- **Multi-Community Membership**: Allows nodes to belong to multiple communities, reflecting the reality of network traffic patterns

- **Best Attack Isolation**: Highest attack community ratio (0.71) among all methods, indicating superior ability to concentrate attack traffic into specific communities

- **Balanced Performance**: Good balance between accuracy (0.75) and attack isolation

- **Specialized Attack Detection**: Best performance for Exploits (F1: 0.92) and Analysis attacks (F1: 0.88)

- **Moderate Computational Cost**: More efficient than GNN methods while providing additional capabilities beyond traditional methods

Overlapping methods are particularly valuable for identifying attacks that span multiple network segments and traffic patterns.

- **Level 1 (Real-time Monitoring)**: Deploy traditional methods (Louvain or Label Propagation) for efficient continuous monitoring
- **Level 2 (Anomaly Investigation)**: Use BigCLAM to analyze flagged traffic for overlapping attack patterns
- **Level 3 (Deep Forensics)**: Apply GCN for in-depth investigation of complex attack vectors

#### 2. Attack-Specific Detection

Select methods based on the attack types of primary concern:
- **DoS & Generic Attacks**: Traditional methods (Louvain, Label Propagation)
- **Exploits & Analysis Attacks**: Overlapping methods (BigCLAM)
- **Backdoor Attacks**: GNN-based methods (GCN)

#### 3. Resource-Optimized Deployment

Tailor deployment based on available computational resources:
- **Limited Resources**: Traditional methods exclusively
- **Moderate Resources**: Traditional + BigCLAM for balanced coverage
- **High-Performance Environment**: Full suite with GNN methods for comprehensive protection

#### 4. Implementation Framework

A recommended implementation pipeline:
1. Preprocess network traffic with Polars for DataFrame operations
2. Construct graphs with RustworkX for efficient graph representation
3. Apply the appropriate community detection methods based on use case
4. Implement automated alert generation based on community analysis

These practical recommendations enable organizations to implement effective network security monitoring using community detection approaches tailored to their specific requirements and constraints.
